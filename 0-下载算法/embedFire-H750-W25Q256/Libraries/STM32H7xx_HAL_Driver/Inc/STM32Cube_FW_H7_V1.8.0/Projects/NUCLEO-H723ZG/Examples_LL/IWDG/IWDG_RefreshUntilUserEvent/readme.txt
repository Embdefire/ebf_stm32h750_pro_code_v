@par Example Description

How to configure the IWDG peripheral to ensure periodical counter update and 
generate an MCU IWDG reset when a User push-button is pressed. The peripheral 
is initialized with LL unitary service functions to optimize 
for performance and size.

At the beginning of the main program the SystemClock_Config() function is called to configure the system clock for STM32H723xx Devices :
The CPU at 520 MHz.
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals, D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4 peripherals at 520 MHz/2.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to run at 520 MHz/4.

Example Configuration:
Configure the IWDG (prescaler, counter) and enable it.
Infinite refresh of the IWDG down-counter done in the main loop.
LED1 is blinking fast & continuously.

Example Execution:
When User push-button is pressed, the down-counter automatic refresh mechanism is 
disabled and thus, reset occurs. After a reset, when re-entering the main function, 
RCC IWDG Reset Flag is checked and if we are back from a IWDG reset the LED1
is switched ON.

Waiting a new User push-button pressed to re-activate the IWDG

@Note If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters (DMAs, DMA2D, LTDC, MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
              Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
              Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series and STM32H7 Series"
